# Dynatrace API: Account Management Postman Collection
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) Collection for Dynatrace Account Management API with all the explanation and support to use the new Oauth2 client.
I've added variables for security and to make them easy to use with multiple Dynatrace Accounts by utilizing [Postman Environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/).

Thanks to my fellow DynaMight [Patrick Hofmann](https://github.com/pahofmann) for his great work creating the [first collections](https://github.com/pahofmann/dynatrace-postman-collections) for the Dynatrace API. Your work inspire me.

# How to

## 1. Create an Oauth2 Client in Dynatrace

   - Open the User menu and select Account settings (in latest Dynatrace, Account Management).
   - On the top navigation bar, go to Identity & access management > OAuth clients.
   - Select Create client.
   - Provide an email of the user who owns the client.
   - Provide a description for the new client.
   - Select the required token scopes. These are the scopes that the client will be able to grant. Tokens generated by the client might have different scope sets.
     - Allow read access for identity resources (users and groups) **account-idm-read**
     - Allow write access for identity resources (users and groups) **account-idm-write**
     - Allow read access for environment resources **account-env-read**
     - Allow write access for environment resources **account-env-write**
     - Allow read access for usage and consumption resources **account-uac-read**
     - Allow write access for usage and consumption resources **account-uac-write**
     - Allow IAM policy configuration for environments. **iam-policies-management**; **iam:policies:read**; **iam:policies:write**; **iam:bindings:read**; **iam:bindings:write**; **iam:effective-permissions:read**.
   - Select Create client.
   - Copy the generated information to the clipboard. Store it in a password manager for future use.
